    <h2> Exercise 1: <em>Logical Operators</em> </h2>
    <p>In the lecture notes, we saw logical operators that acted on pairs of boolean values to produce other booleans. One such operator was <code>and</code>.</p>

    <p>Since there are only two distinct boolean values (<code>True</code> and <code>False</code>), and there are two arguments in each call using the <code>and</code> operator, there will be 4 combinations that define the effect of this operator. Compute and print the truth value of these four combinations.</p>

    <p>We can collate this data into a truth table. This effectively gives a definition of the <code>and</code> operator.</p>
